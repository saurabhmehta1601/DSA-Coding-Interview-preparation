Find max depth of a binary tree.


                   1                     depth---0
                /     \
              2         3                        depth---1
            /   \     /    \
           4    5    6      7                          depth---2

max depth of a tree is same as its height.

height of any node is  1 + height of its larger subtree (left one or right one )
