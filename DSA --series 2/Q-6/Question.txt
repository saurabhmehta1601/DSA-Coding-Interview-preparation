Given an array a[] and integer k, find indices i,j such  that 
         a[i]==a[j] and   i-j <= k
         

Approach for O(n) solution


Create a hashmap storing elements and their index as you traverse through the vector array
if element not present in map insert it with its index else
cheak if the differce in current index of number is at distance of k or less than its 
previous occurance index if yess return true else update the index of this number to 
current

At last if true is not returned while iterating over the whole list than 
return false
