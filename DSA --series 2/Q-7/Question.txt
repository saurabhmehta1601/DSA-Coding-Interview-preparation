Approach for O(n) solution

            If both strings don't have equal length return false

            Take first string and a hashmap.  Iterate over string and for 
            each of its letter  increase the no of count  of that alphabet 
            in hashmap by 1.

            Now take second string for each letter in second string decrese
            the count of that alphabet in map by 1.

            After traversing the second string is the count of any alphabet in hashmap
            is non zero then return false else return true
