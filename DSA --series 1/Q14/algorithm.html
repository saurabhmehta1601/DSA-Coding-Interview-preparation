<!-- We have to find node whose distance is n from end -->

Take two pointers ptr1 and ptr2
point both to list begin or head

step 1-->  Move ptr1 by n steps one step at time
step 2-->  Now move ptr1 and ptr2 both one step at time until 
                ptr2 doesn't reach end
step 3-->  since ptr2 is n steps behind ptr1 and ptr1 points to last node
              ptr2 is at n steps distance from end thus ptr2 is answer
