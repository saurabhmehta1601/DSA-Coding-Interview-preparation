We have to find no of nodes at each level in tree>

Login: after inserting nodes in queue insert an extra node with some value
which will act as separator .
    Maintain another list storing no of nodes at each level

    
          1
        / | \
      2   3  4
      |      |
      5      6

      push root and separator and initialize widths column with 0 for top level width

      queue => 1--'s'                       widths=[0]

    unshift and  insert childs of front node and increse width column value by 1
     
    queue=> 's'--2--3--4                     widths=[1]

    whenever s at front and list size > 1 add new width column with 0 value
     and move s from front to end

     queue=> 2--3--4--'s'    widths=[1,0]

    queue=> 3--4--'s'--5    widths=[1,1] childs of 2 added

     queue=> 4--'s'--5    widths=[1,2] childs of 3 added or since no nodes present

     queue=> 's'--5--6    widths=[1,3] childs of 4 added

    queue=> 5--6--'s'     widths=[1,3,0]

    queue=> 6--'s'     widths=[1,3,1] child of 5 added since no childs same

    queue=> 's'     widths=[1,3,2] child of 5 added since no childs same
    
since length of queue is 1 thus only separator present

return width list
