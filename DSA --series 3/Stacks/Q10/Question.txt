Next Greater Frequency Element

Given an array, for each element find the value of the nearest element to the right which is having a frequency greater than as that of the current element. If there does not exist an answer for a position, then make the value ‘-1’.

Naive approach: 
A simple hashing technique is to use values as the index is being used to store the frequency of each element. Create a list suppose to store the frequency of each number in the array. (Single traversal is required). Now use two loops. 
The outer loop picks all the elements one by one. 
The inner loop looks for the first element whose frequency is greater than the frequency of the current element. 
If a greater frequency element is found then that element is printed, otherwise -1 is printed. 
Time complexity: O(n*n)



Efficient Approach

We can use hashing and stack data structure to efficiently solve for many cases. A simple hashing technique is to use values as index and frequency of each element as value. We use the stack data structure to store the position of elements in the array.
